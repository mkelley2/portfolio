From time to time I also helped out in other departments when I was needed.

                     So now you know what I can do. But what now you have got to be wondering, who am I and what do I do for <strong>fun</strong>. I grew up in San Diego, Ca. During my time there I spent every bit of it I could enjoying everything San Diego has to offer to a kid. Everything from surfing, to wakeboarding or even just bicycling down the boardwalk. Seaworld was a short drive from my house so I spent many weekends during the summer there. My family also spent most of our holiday vacations camping. Our most popular location was the Colorado River and the dunes in Glamis. I also played a few sports including baseball, soccer and roller hockey. Hockey was by far my favorite</p>
                      
                      <p>At 13 I moved to Portland, OR and stayed through High School. After the move I transitioned from roller hockey to ice. But when I made it to High School I ended up having to play for a completely different school than where I went since my school did not have it's own team. Which was awkward to say the least.</p>
                      
                      <p>When I graduated High School my next adventure was College. I decided I wanted to be an Air Traffic Controller at a young age so I made my way to University of North Dakota. UND has the best civilian ATC training program but it also has the drawback of being in North Dakota. I went to UND for 2 years and spent some of that time working toward smy Pilot's License when I decided that Aviation was just not for me. I moved on but stayed in ND as I decided what was next. It was also during this time that my interest in computers grew. I learned how to build my first PC and got pretty into PC gaming. Since then I have taken apart and upgraded various computer components many times.</p>
                      
                      <p>Eventually while trying decide what I wanted to do next I decided on coding. During High School I had taken every computer class they offered and I enjoyed every single one of them. So since there are so many opportnities here I made my way back to Portland. My first step was to make it through the Full Stack JavaScript course at Portland Code School. I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot but unfortunately the school close down in the last weeks of class. But we did not give up. The students and teachers preservered on and finished the course outside the school at where ever would take us. During this time is when I finished my capstone project with my partner. After that the job hunt began</p>
                      
                      <p>After a few months of job search I decided I wanted to get some more tools in belt to help secure a better job. That is when I decided to go to Epicodus. Which brings us to where we are now with you reading this portfolio and hopefully with a job offer.</p>
